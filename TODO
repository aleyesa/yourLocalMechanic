      []Get conditional statement working with username.


      Hiding a message: 

      Tap on header(when we create one).

      How message thread works:

        We created an ajax function that gets:

          [O] All messages from specified client
          [O] All messages from specified car shop Owner

          For the currently logged in user:

            We should hide the message if the user's 'removedMsg' value is true
            if show the message like normal

            We should also check if both the client and car shop owner 'removedMsg' value is true
            If it is then we delete that specified message.
